    "- What is a linear combination?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let there be a set of vectors $\\{v_1, \\ldots, v_n\\}$.  linear combination of these vectors is a sum \n",
    "$$\\alpha_1 v_1 + \\ldots + \\alpha_n v_n$$\n",
    "where $\\alpha_1, \\ldots , \\alpha_n$ are scalars. Recall that scalars are field elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are coefficients? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a linear combination, coefficients are the scalar elements that the vectors get multiplied by. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the span of vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "A span is all the possible linear combination of a set of vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are standard generators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard generators are a set of vectors which the span of is equivalent to a given set. For example, a generator for $\\R^3$ could be the set of vectors $\\{[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are examples of flats?\n",
    "\n",
    "An examples of a flat include line in through the origin $\\R^2$, or the solution to any homogenous linear system. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What is a homogeneous linear equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an equation with the form $\\alpha x + \\beta = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is a homogeneous linear system?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is is a set of homogenous linear equations with a solution or solutions which satisfies all of equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the two kinds of representations of flats containing the origin?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A span of vectors \n",
    "2. Solution to a homogeneous system of equations\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is a vector space?\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector space $\\mathbb V$ is a set of vectors which satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "1. Contains the zero vector \n",
    "2. Closed under scalar-multiplication\n",
    "3. Closed under vector addition\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is a subspace? \n",
    "\n",
    "If V and W are vector spaces, and V is a subset of W, then V is called a subspace of W. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What is a affine combination? \n",
    "\n",
    "An affine combination is a linear combination where the coefficients add up to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the affine hull of vectors? \n",
    "\n",
    "An affine hull is the set of all affine combinations of a collection of vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What is an affine space? \n",
    "\n",
    "An affine space is a vector space that is translated. For example $A$ is an affine space if there is a vector space $V$ and a vector $a$ where $A = \\{a + v : v \\in V\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the two kinds of representations of flats not containing the origin?\n",
    "\n",
    "A flat not containing the origin can be represented as translation of a vector space V, or as the affine hull of some vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "-  Is the solution set of a linear system always an affine space?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the linear system has at least one solution $u_1$ then the solution set is $\\{ u_1 + v : v \\in V\\}. "
